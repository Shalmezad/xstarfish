(1)  Read the README file if you want to find out how it works.

(2)  Type "make" to build the program.

(3)  If the program built successfully, type "make install" to
     copy the binary into /usr/local/bin/. This must be done as
     root.

(4)  If you like starfish and want it to run automatically, add
     a line that invokes Starfish with your favourite options
     to your ~/.Xsession file. This way starfish will be run
     every time you enter X.

Have fun!

This is known to build under linux using gcc. It uses no OS-specific
calls or features that I know of, and should build & run properly
on any machine with access to Xlib and a copy of fork() in its
kernel. If it doesn't run on your unix, please let me know and I'll
endeavour to fix whatever I did wrong.
